# Blade Runner android hunter
First idea was to create a simple script that work with a single command line in DOS.
Search and destroys a series annoying applications that hindered me to work at certain times of the day ( however could not be uninstalled )

Later i Implemented for the same script down any other user logged.

## Motivation
All machines work were required to use a bad application (malformed robot browser). I say bad, because it was not able to manage excessive use of machine resources (99% all resources) and frequently crashes.

## Need to work:
* Windows 7 (x86)
* Python 2.7
* Run as administrator

## Example of use:
```MSDOS
python balde.py Robot1 Robot2 Robot3
```
